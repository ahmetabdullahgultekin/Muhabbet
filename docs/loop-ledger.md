# Muhabbet Daily Loop — Ledger

> Append-only record of the autonomous daily loop (`/loop`). Each entry = one day's pick.
> **Purpose:** make "do one of the best of these" and "start from the **least executed / never
> reviewed**" *deterministic* — the loop reads this file first to choose, instead of re-deriving
> state from scratch every run. Newest entries on top.
>
> **Job definition / runbook:** [`docs/loop-job.md`](loop-job.md) (selection rule, definition of
> done, safety boundaries, scheduling status).

## Task rotation (the 4 loop tasks)
1. **Research + roadmap** — survey Telegram/Signal/WhatsApp features, update `ROADMAP.md`.
2. **Plan + design docs** — deeply spec the next feature (SE lifecycle docs).
3. **V&V / review** — verify/test/inspect existing features, **least-reviewed first**.
4. **Optimize** — improve the system *and this loop/prompt itself*.

## Module/feature review coverage (Task 3 — keep current; pick the lowest count next)
| Area | Dedicated review? | Last reviewed | Notes |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| backend `media` | ✅ | 2026-06-08 | `docs/reviews/2026-06-08-media-module-vv.md` (fixed Finding A) |
| backend `moderation` | partial | 2026-06-07 | IDOR Q in `docs/qa/02-security.md`; no full module review |
| backend `messaging` | partial | 2026-06-07 | IDOR fixes PR #55; 24 test files; no holistic review |
| backend `auth` | partial | 2026-06-07 | JWT boot-guard PR #55; no full module review |
| backend `presence` (adapter) | ✅ | 2026-06-08 | `docs/reviews/2026-06-08-presence-notification-vv.md` (fixed C/D/E; A KVKK-visibility + B FCM-cleanup → TODO P2) |
| backend `notification` (adapter) | ✅ | 2026-06-08 | same doc — push-body DRY (D) + `registerPushToken` status/string (C) fixed; FCM stale-token cleanup (B) → TODO P2 |
| mobile (CMP) | UI-audit only | 2026-06-07 | `docs/qa/mobile-ui-audit.md` (87 issues); no logic V&V |
| shared (KMP) | ✅ | 2026-06-08 | `docs/reviews/2026-06-08-shared-kmp-vv.md` (fixed `!!` A + test gaps B; Instant-deprecation C + dead video rules D → TODO P2). Clean wire contract. |

**Next V&V pick (least reviewed):** a holistic `auth` / `moderation` / `messaging` module review
(currently only "partial" — IDOR/JWT fixes landed but no full module review). All dedicated areas
now reviewed at least once.

## Entries

### 2026-06-08 (run 11) — PARALLEL batch 4 (4 agents): innovation flagships + KVKK/security
- **Trigger:** owner "devam" → next roadmap wave: deliver the two differentiation flagships as REAL
  code + close the remaining KVKK/security findings. 4 agents based on `6402f51`.
- **Slices (integrated via cherry-pick; combined gate re-run by me):**
  1. **D4 Mahrem Mod (Privacy Mode) S1** (mobile, flagship) — `PrivacyModeConfig.ENABLED` default OFF;
     real persisted toggles, PIN app-lock (salt + 10k-round SHA-256 in EncryptedSharedPrefs/Keychain),
     Android `FLAG_SECURE` screenshot guard, FCM preview hiding. iOS screenshot guard = honest stub
     (no Xcode), not a silent fake. common+iOS metadata compile green.
  2. **D5 Turkish voice→summary** (mobile, flagship) — real frequency-based extractive summarizer
     (Turkish sentence-split + stop-words + sentence scoring, 160-char budget, dotted/dotless-I), no
     LLM/mock; VoiceBubble "Özet" line, flag OFF; 9 tests (+JVM-harness found/fixed 2 real bugs).
  3. **InputSanitizer wiring** (security Finding E) — added `normalizeText` (strip control/zero-width/
     bidi, clamp; NO HTML-escape on input → no double-escape) at the service boundary for displayName/
     about/group/community/bot/status fields; message bodies untouched; +13 tests incl. anti-double-
     escape guards.
  4. **WS presence KVKK visibility** (presence Finding A) — realtime presence/typing now honor
     `onlineStatusVisibility` via shared `PresenceVisibilityPolicy` (everyone/contacts/nobody,
     fail-closed); N+1-free; +12 tests.
- **Boundaries:** crypto untouched (flags OFF), no deploy. Both flagship innovations ship dark.

### 2026-06-08 (run 10) — PARALLEL batch 3 (4 agents): "make prod real, zero hidden mocks"
- **Trigger:** owner — "tüm mockları kaldır, gerçek entegrasyonlar yap; sıfır mock/fake; 'feature
  aktif değil' kabul ama mock değil." Set the boundary first (crypto NoOps stay — can't fake crypto),
  then launched 4 agents based on `b5385ba`.
- **Slices (integrated via cherry-pick; combined gate re-run by me):**
  1. **Real OTP SMS** — `MockOtpSender` → dev-only; real `NetgsmOtpSender` + `TwilioOtpSender`
     (Spring `RestClient`, `@ConditionalOnProperty muhabbet.sms.provider`), removed heavy Twilio SDK,
     `OTP_SEND_FAILED` ErrorCode, prod config `OTP_MOCK_ENABLED=false` + provider env. +8 tests
     (request-building + response-mapping; live SMS delivery NOT verifiable here — needs real account).
  2. **Real FCM + dead-token cleanup** (closes presence/notif Finding B) — FCM `UNREGISTERED`/
     `INVALID_ARGUMENT`/`SENDER_ID_MISMATCH` → auto-invalidate token via new `PushTokenInvalidationPort`
     (clean cross-module out-port, not JPA import); loud NoOp fallback. +11 tests.
  3. **`shared` KMP V&V** (run 9 entry) — last never-reviewed area; fixed lone `!!` + 23 tests (53→76);
     wire contract clean.
  4. **Mock-elimination ledger** — `docs/MOCK_ELIMINATION.md`: 3 DEV-FALLBACK (env-gated) / 10
     CRYPTO-BLOCKED (libsignal, not faked) / 2 PLATFORM-STUB (iOS) / 22 FALSE-POSITIVE; prod-config
     checklist (SMS provider + LiveKit decision flagged).
- **Boundaries honored:** crypto NoOps/throws untouched (flag-OFF + honest UI = "feature not active",
  not a hidden mock); no deploy.

### 2026-06-08 (run 9) — Task 3 (V&V): `shared` KMP module review (LAST never-reviewed area)
- **Picked because:** per the coverage table, `shared` (KMP) was the single remaining
  never-reviewed area — and the highest-leverage one, being the wire contract both backend and
  mobile deserialize.
- **Did:** full static review of all 9 `commonMain` files (model/dto/protocol/validation/port);
  wrote `docs/reviews/2026-06-08-shared-kmp-vv.md` (4 findings). Cross-checked every `@SerialName`
  discriminator against `CLAUDE.md`, traced `ValidationRules` consumers across backend+mobile,
  verified old-client serialization compat, enum sync, and the crypto-blocked seams' fail-modes.
- **Fixed:** Finding A — the lone `!!` in `shared/commonMain` (`NoOpKeyManager.generateIdentityKeyPair`
  `return identityKey!!` → local-val) violating the `CLAUDE.md` no-`!!` rule. Finding B — added 3
  test files (~23 tests): `WsDiscriminatorContractTest` (pins **every** WS type string),
  `EncryptionPortTest` + jvmTest `EncryptionPortSuspendTest` (NoOp passthrough), `ValidationRulesTest`
  (limit boundaries). Shared `jvmTest` 53 → **76**, 0 failures.
- **Documented → TODO P2:** Finding C (`kotlinx.datetime.Instant` deprecated in Kotlin 2.3.20 →
  `kotlin.time.Instant`; cross-module wire type, migrate atomically), Finding D (`ALLOWED_VIDEO_TYPES`
  + `MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_BYTES` have zero consumers — no video-upload path; YAGNI dead code).
- **Result:** wire contract is **clean** — no serialization regressions, no old-client-breaking
  fields, nullability/enum-sync correct, blocked crypto seams throw/passthrough as desired.
- **Verification:** `:shared:jvmTest` 76/0; `:mobile:composeApp:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` green.
- **Boundaries:** no crypto implemented, no WS contract break (no edits to discriminators/types),
  no deploy, no push.
- **Commit:** branch `loop3/vv-shared`.

### 2026-06-08 (run 8) — PARALLEL batch 2 (4 agents, worktree-isolated, based on 40c403a)
- **Trigger:** owner "yol haritasını sen belirliyorsun, sonraki batch'i de ayarla" → I set the
  roadmap and launched 4 concurrent agents (all correctly based on latest `origin` this time).
- **Slices (all integrated via cherry-pick onto the work branch; combined gate re-run by me):**
  1. **V&V presence + notification** (never-reviewed) — 6 findings; fixed C (inline-TR-string + wrong
     401→`DEVICE_NOT_FOUND`), D (push-body DRY `PushNotificationContent`), E (dead TTL-less `lastseen:`
     Redis write removed) + 15 tests; A (WS presence ignores `onlineStatusVisibility` — KVKK) + B (FCM
     stale-token not cleaned) → TODO P2.
  2. **V&V cross-cutting security** — found + fixed 2 real WS authz holes: read-receipt spoof
     (`updateStatus` broadcast w/o membership) + typing spoof; WS `ServerAck` no longer echoes raw
     `e.message`; +`JwtProviderTest` (alg-confusion/tamper/expiry/forgery, 10 tests). E (InputSanitizer
     has zero call sites) + F (ack conv-id cross-check) → TODO P2. Headers/CORS/SSRF/rate-limit verified clean.
  3. **@mentions S3/UI** (mobile) — `MentionsConfig.ENABLED` (default OFF), composer `@` autocomplete
     + çini-cobalt bubble highlight, roster from existing `participants`. Compile green.
  4. **D3 perf** — `docs/qa/perf-budget.md` (5-flow budgets + measurement) + dropped redundant
     `DISTINCT` on 2 membership-scoped read queries (provably 1:1 join) + Testcontainers test lock.
- **Boundaries:** no crypto flags, no disabled Signal files, no deploy.

### 2026-06-08 (run 7) — PARALLEL batch (4 agents, worktree-isolated)
- **Trigger:** owner "paralel hareket edemiyor musun?" → launched 4 concurrent subagents in isolated
  git worktrees, each on a disjoint slice; integrated all into the single work branch via cherry-pick.
- **Slices:**
  1. **@mentions S2** (backend persist+validate; `MentionRepository` + JPA adapter + entity, member-
     drop + `@everyone` admin-gate, 2 new ErrorCodes, +5 MockK tests) — `MessagingServiceTest` 26/26.
  2. **Media Finding B** (force `response-content-disposition=attachment` on MinIO presigned GETs;
     +3 tests) — closes the inline-render / stored-XSS surface; review doc + TODO updated.
  3. **D2 motion** (`reactionPop` + `bubbleEntrance(enabled)` wired baseline-gated, scroll-safe).
  4. **Platform expansion plan** (`docs/design/PLATFORM_EXPANSION_PLAN.md`, 414 lines, code-grounded:
     iOS shell → Desktop JVM → WasmJS web sequence).
- **Integration:** agents committed on local `loop/*` branches (diverged bases), cherry-picked onto
  `claude/relaxed-goldberg-P1IKj`; resolved one add/add conflict on the media V&V doc + de-duplicated
  a TODO entry. Combined gate re-run by me (not just per-agent isolation).
- **Boundaries:** no crypto flags, no disabled Signal files, no deploy.

### 2026-06-08 (run 6) — Design impl D2: motion language foundation + press feedback
- **Trigger:** owner "durmak yok, profesyonel ve önerilen şekilde ilerle" → continued with the
  recommended D2 (motion).
- **Did:** new `MuhabbetMotion.kt` — canonical motion tokens (3 durations, 3 easing curves, 3 spring
  specs) + reusable `Modifier.pressBounce` (scroll-safe tactile press) and `Modifier.bubbleEntrance`
  (signature lift+settle, opt-in for new messages). Wired `pressBounce` into the chat `MessageBubble`
  (shared `MutableInteractionSource` with `combinedClickable`). Spec: `docs/design/D2-motion-spec.md`.
- **Verification:** `:mobile:composeApp:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` green. Device-visual
  verification pending a real APK (full Android app doesn't assemble on this host).
- **Boundaries:** UI motion only; no crypto, no deploy.
- **Commit:** branch `claude/relaxed-goldberg-P1IKj`.

### 2026-06-08 (run 5) — Design impl D1: own brand identity (İznik çini palette)
- **Trigger:** owner chose "Türk turkuazı / çini" for D1 (highest-leverage gap from run-4 vision:
  we shipped WhatsApp's exact palette).
- **Did:** replaced the WhatsApp-cloned palette in `MuhabbetTheme.kt` with an İznik-çini identity —
  firuze (turquoise) primary `#0E94A8`/`#26B3C7`, kobalt (cobalt) read-ticks/links, mercan (coral)
  warm accent; warm-ivory light wallpaper, pale-firuze own-bubble, teal-shifted dark surfaces. All
  `WhatsApp*` constants renamed `Cini*`; updated 3 semantic-color sets + 3 M3 schemes (light/dark/
  OLED). No call sites touched (pure token swap). Spec: `docs/design/D1-brand-color-identity.md`.
- **Verification:** `:mobile:composeApp:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` green; grep confirms no
  leftover WhatsApp color refs / hardcoded old greens in mobile.
- **Boundaries:** UI tokens only; no crypto, no deploy.
- **Commit:** branch `claude/relaxed-goldberg-P1IKj`.

### 2026-06-08 (run 4) — Task 1/2 (Research + vision): Product Design & Innovation Vision
- **Trigger:** owner directive — design & innovation must *differentiate*, not just reach parity;
  picked all 3 pillars + "research first" (`docs/loop-job.md` §2a).
- **Did:** `docs/design/PRODUCT_DESIGN_INNOVATION_VISION.md` — competitive scan (2026 web research:
  WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal/Session), the differentiation gap (**we ship WhatsApp's exact palette** —
  `MuhabbetTheme.kt` `0xFF00A884`), Muhabbet's open lane (sovereign + privacy-first + warm + Turkish),
  3 pillars (visual identity & motion / speed & flow / TR innovation), scored innovation idea pool,
  **north-star** (own identity + flagship pair: **Mahrem Mod** + **Turkish voice→text+summary**), and
  D1–D5 flagged slices wired into the loop.
- **Verification:** docs-only; research cited (6 sources); grounded in real code (`MuhabbetTheme.kt`).
- **Boundaries:** none of D1–D5 touch libsignal/E2E flags; no deploy.
- **Commit:** branch `claude/relaxed-goldberg-P1IKj`.

### 2026-06-08 (run 3) — Implementation: @mentions slice S1 (contract + migration + flag)
- **Context:** user said "skip loop, start working" → implemented the first vertical slice of the
  @mentions design from run 2 (the obvious, low-regret next step: additive + default-OFF).
- **Did (S1, behavior-neutral):** `V19__add_message_mentions.sql` (additive table + `mentions_everyone`
  column); `MentionRef` + optional `mentions`/`mentionsEveryone` on shared `Message`,
  `WsMessage.SendMessage`, `WsMessage.NewMessage`; backend `Mention` value object + `Message` fields;
  `MentionProperties` flag (`muhabbet.mentions.enabled`, default OFF) wired in `AppConfig` +
  `application.yml`. `MessageJpaEntity` left unmapped for the new column on purpose (persistence is S2).
- **Tests:** added old-client-compat + round-trip cases to `WsMessageSerializationTest`.
- **Verification:** `:shared:jvmTest` green, `:backend:compileKotlin` green, mobile commonMain
  metadata compile green. CHANGELOG + design-doc status + this ledger updated.
- **Boundaries:** no crypto flags flipped, no disabled Signal files touched, no deploy.
- **Commit:** branch `claude/relaxed-goldberg-P1IKj`.

### 2026-06-08 (run 2) — Task 2 (Plan + design docs): @mentions in group chats
- **Picked because:** rotation — Tasks 3 & 4 already done today; Task 2 never run by the loop.
  Chose @mentions as the next feature (non-blocked, no crypto/deploy, high group-usability value).
- **Did:** full SE-lifecycle design — `docs/design/T2-group-mentions.md` (context→goals→data model
  `V19__add_message_mentions.sql`→additive WS/DTO contract→hexagonal file tree→default-OFF flag
  `muhabbet.mentions.enabled`→S1…S5 vertical slices→test plan→risks→rollback), ADR-0008
  (`docs/adr/0008-mentions-storage-and-notification.md`), sequence diagram
  (`docs/diagrams/mentions-sequence.mmd`), and wired it into `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Key decisions:** structured client-resolved/server-validated mentions (no server-side `@name`
  regex); mentions pierce conversation-mute but respect global-mute/block; `@everyone` admin-gated +
  size-capped; explicit E2E boundary (must not weaken E2E; notify-set moves client-side post-libsignal).
- **Verification:** design-only run (no code) — verified the doc against real code: migration head is
  V18 (→V19), real `SendMessage`/`NewMessage` shapes, `MediaAccessQueryRepository` soft-FK pattern
  reused for membership decoupling.
- **Commit:** branch `claude/relaxed-goldberg-P1IKj`.

### 2026-06-08 — Task 3 (V&V): `media` module review
- **Picked because:** thinnest-tested backend module (2 test files), never had a dedicated review.
- **Did:** full static review of all 17 media source files; wrote
  `docs/reviews/2026-06-08-media-module-vv.md` (5 findings).
- **Fixed:** Finding A — `uploadDocument` derived the MinIO object-key extension from the
  unsanitized client filename → path-segment (`/`, `..`) injection. Added `safeExtension()`
  (alphanumeric, length-capped, `bin` fallback) + 6 `uploadDocument` unit tests (method had 0).
- **Deferred (added to `TODO.md`):** Finding B (force `attachment` disposition on presigned URLs —
  owner decision), Finding C (storage-usage doc bucketing).
- **Verification:** `:backend:test --tests MediaServiceTest` green.
- **Also (Task 4 — optimize the loop):** formalized & documented the job itself —
  `docs/loop-job.md` (definition, selection rule, definition-of-done, safety boundaries,
  scheduling gap) + this ledger. Surfaced the scheduling gap: this remote env has no
  `ScheduleWakeup`/cron primitive, so the loop can't self-re-arm — needs an external daily trigger.
- **Commit:** see branch `claude/relaxed-goldberg-P1IKj`.
